# Operating Systems and System Programming Tasks

This repository contains a collection of tasks aimed at enhancing your understanding and implementation skills in operating systems and system programming concepts. Each task covers a specific aspect of Unix/Linux environments and provides an opportunity to practice your knowledge.

## Task List:

1. **Shell Scripting**:
    - Concatenation of two strings
    - Comparison of two strings
    - Maximum of three numbers
    - Fibonacci series
    - Arithmetic operation using case
    - Checking whether a given number is a palindrome or not
    - Finding the largest of N numbers (storing numbers in an array)
    - Generating prime numbers
    - Reading two matrices and finding their sum
    - Simulation of ls, rm, cat, and grep commands using system calls

2. **Programs using System Calls**:
    - Creating parent and child processes
    - Demonstrating the creation of Zombie and Orphan processes
    - File I/O operations like reading characters, skipping characters, and positioning in the file
    - Reading from a file and writing into a new file

3. **Inter-Process Communication**:
    - Implementing the Producer-Consumer problem using shared memory
    - Generating first N odd numbers and sharing them between parent and child processes using shared memory
    - Generating and printing Fibonacci series using shared memory
    - Generating and printing prime numbers between a given range using shared memory

4. **Multi-threading**:
    - Calculating the natural sum and factorial using two threads and the main thread

5. **CPU Scheduling**:
    - Implementing FCFS scheduling algorithm
    - Implementing SJF, SJF Preemptive, Priority, and Priority Preemptive scheduling algorithms
    - Implementing Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm with arrival time

6. **Synchronization**:
    - Implementing the Producer-Consumer problem and Reader-Writer problem using mutex and semaphores

## Getting Started:

Each task directory contains instructions and guidelines for implementing the task. You'll find detailed explanations, requirements, and sometimes sample code to get started. Follow the instructions provided in each task directory to complete the implementation.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Unix/Linux environments
- Familiarity with C programming language for system programming tasks
- Knowledge of shell scripting for shell scripting tasks
- Understanding of operating system concepts such as processes, threads, inter-process communication, CPU scheduling, and synchronization mechanisms
